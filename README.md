### 🎯 Architecture Benefits
- **🔧 Modular Design**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **🧪 Easy Testing**: Isolated modules enable comprehensive unit testing
- **⚙️ Configuration Management**: All settings centralized and easily customizable
- **📈 Scalability**: Professional structure supports future enhancements
- **🛡️ Maintainability**: Clear separation makes debugging and updates simple
- **🚀 Professional Standards**: Follows Python packaging and development best practices

## 📊 Advanced Scoring System

### 🎯 Points Award Rules
- **🥇 Fastest Correct Answer**: +1 base point + penalty points from all wrong answers in the round
- **✅ Other Correct Answers**: +1 point each
- **❌ Wrong Answer or Timeout**: -1 point (contributes to penalty pool)
- **⚠️ Consecutive Wrong Answers**: 3 strikes = automatic disqualification

### 🏁 Position Calculation
- **Formula**: Position = max(1, 1 + total_score)
- **Minimum**: Position never goes below 1 (start line protection)
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach track_length wins the race
- **Dynamic Tracks**: Track length varies (4-25 units) for game variety

### 💡 Strategic Scoring Examples

**Scenario: 4 players, 2 wrong answers in round:**
- 🥇 Player A (fastest correct): **+3 points** (1 base + 2 penalty bonus)
- ✅ Player B (correct): **+1 point**
- ❌ Player C (wrong): **-1 point** 
- ⏰ Player D (timeout): **-1 point**

**Result**: Speed + accuracy = maximum advancement!

## ⚙️ Configuration Management

All game settings are centralized in `config/settings.py` for easy customization:

```python
# Server Configuration
DEFAULT_HOST = 'localhost'      # Server binding address
DEFAULT_PORT = 12345           # Default port (auto-discovery available)
MAX_CLIENTS = 10               # Maximum concurrent players
MIN_CLIENTS = 2                # Minimum players to start game

# Game Mechanics  
MIN_TRACK_LENGTH = 4           # Shortest possible race
MAX_TRACK_LENGTH = 25          # Longest possible race
TIME_LIMIT = 100.0             # Seconds per round
MAX_WRONG_STREAK = 3           # Strikes before disqualification

# Math Expression Settings
MIN_NUMBER = -10000            # Minimum operand value
MAX_NUMBER = 10000             # Maximum operand value
OPERATORS = ['+', '-', '*', '/', '%']  # Available operators

# Network Settings
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024             # Socket buffer size
SELECT_TIMEOUT = 0.1           # Non-blocking timeout

# Scoring Settings
BASE_POINTS = 1                # Points for correct answers
PENALTY_POINTS = -1            # Points deducted for mistakes
```

### 🔧 Easy Customization
- **Difficulty**: Adjust `MIN_NUMBER`, `MAX_NUMBER`, and `TIME_LIMIT`
- **Game Length**: Modify `MIN_TRACK_LENGTH` and `MAX_TRACK_LENGTH` 
- **Player Limits**: Change `MIN_CLIENTS` and `MAX_CLIENTS`
- **Network**: Customize `DEFAULT_HOST`, `DEFAULT_PORT`, and timeouts

## �🐛 Troubleshooting & Support

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

**"Address already in use" Error:**
```bash
# Option 1: Kill existing processes
pkill -f "python.*main.py"

# Option 2: Use different port
python main.py --mode server --port 12346

# Option 3: Wait for socket timeout (~30 seconds)
```

**Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check server status
netstat -an | grep 12345

# Test localhost connectivity
telnet localhost 12345

# Verify firewall settings (if needed)
```

**Game Won't Start:**
- ✅ Ensure minimum 2 players are connected
- ✅ Check all players completed registration
- ✅ Verify server shows "Race starting" message

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "python.*main.py")

# Enable debug mode (if available)
python main.py --mode server --debug
```

### 🔍 Debug Mode
Add diagnostic information by modifying `config/settings.py`:
```python
DEBUG_MODE = True              # Enable verbose logging
LOG_NETWORK_TRAFFIC = True     # Log all messages
PERFORMANCE_MONITORING = True  # Track response times
