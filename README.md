# Racing Arena - Terminal-Based Multiplayer Math Game

A real-time multiplayer terminal game where players compete by solving math expressions to advance their racing positions. Built with non-blocking socket programming in Python.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Racing Arena is a competitive math game where:
- Players connect to a central server and compete in real-time
- Each round presents a math expression that players must solve quickly
- Scoring is based on correctness and speed
- Players advance positions on a race track based on their scores
- First player to reach the finish line wins!

## 🚀 Features

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Real-time multiplayer**: 2-10 players can compete simultaneously
- **Math expressions**: Random expressions with integers (-10,000 to 10,000) and operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- **Smart scoring system**: 
  - Fastest correct answer gets bonus points equal to total penalties
  - Other correct answers get +1 point
  - Wrong answers or timeouts get -1 point
- **Position-based racing**: Players move forward/backward based on cumulative score
- **Disqualification**: 3 consecutive wrong answers removes a player
- **Auto-restart**: New races begin automatically when someone wins

### Technical Features
- **Non-blocking sockets**: Server handles multiple clients without blocking
- **Real-time communication**: JSON-based message protocol
- **Connection handling**: Graceful client connect/disconnect
- **Error resilience**: Robust error handling and recovery

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Terminal/Command line access
- Network connectivity for multiplayer

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download** the game files:
   ```bash
   # Download main.py to your desired directory
   cd /path/to/racing-arena
   ```

2. **No additional installation required** - uses Python standard library only

## 🎯 How to Play

### Starting the Server
```bash
python main.py server
```

The server will start and display:
```
[Server] Starting...
```

### Connecting as a Player
```bash
python main.py
```

### Game Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - Enter a unique nickname when prompted
   - Wait for other players (need 2-10 total)

2. **Race Start**:
   - Server announces race details (track length: 4-25 units)
   - All players start at position 1

3. **Game Rounds**:
   - Server presents math expressions like: `23 * -4 = ?`
   - Type your answer and press Enter
   - Results show response times and scoring

4. **Winning**:
   - First player to reach the finish line wins
   - New race starts automatically

### Example Game Session

**Server Output:**
```
[Server] Starting...
[Server] Player connected: speedy_7
[Server] Player connected: racer_9
[Server] Race starting with 2 players
[Server] Track length: 10 units
[Round 1]
Sent expression: 23 * -4
Received:
  speedy_7: -92 (1.2s)
  racer_9: -91 (1.8s)
Points:
  speedy_7 +1 | position 2
  racer_9 +0 | position 1
```

**Client Output:**
```
Welcome to Racing Arena!
Enter your nickname: speedy_7
Registration Completed Successfully
Waiting for other players...
Race Started! Track length: 10
Your position: 1
[Round 1]
Solve: 23 * -4 = ?
> -92
Correct answer: -92
Received:
speedy_7: -92 (1.2s)
racer_9: -91 (1.8s)

Positions:
speedy_7 → 2
racer_9 → 1
```

## 📊 Scoring System

### Points Award Rules
- **Fastest Correct Answer**: +1 point + penalty points from all wrong answers in the round
- **Other Correct Answers**: +1 point
- **Wrong Answer or Timeout**: -1 point
- **Consecutive Wrong Answers**: 3 in a row = disqualification

### Position Calculation
- Position = 1 + total_score
- Minimum position is always 1 (can't go backward from start)
- Race ends when any player reaches track_length

### Example Scoring Scenarios

**Round with 4 players, 2 wrong answers:**
- Player A (fastest correct): +3 points (1 base + 2 penalties)
- Player B (correct): +1 point
- Player C (wrong): -1 point
- Player D (timeout): -1 point

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Server Architecture
- **Non-blocking socket server** using `select.select()`
- **Event-driven design** with game loop processing
- **Client state management** (nickname, score, position, wrong streak)
- **Round-based timing** with configurable time limits

### Communication Protocol
All messages use JSON format:

**Client → Server:**
```json
{"nickname": "player_name"}
{"answer": "42"}
```

**Server → Client:**
```json
{"message": "Welcome to Racing Arena!"}
{"message": "Solve: 15 + 27 = ?"}
```

### File Structure
```
racing-area/
├── main.py          # Main game implementation
├── test_client.py   # Automated testing client
└── README.md        # This documentation
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start server: `python main.py server`
2. Open multiple terminals and connect clients: `python main.py`
3. Test various scenarios (correct/wrong answers, timeouts, disconnections)

### Automated Testing
```bash
python test_client.py
```

This runs automated clients that:
- Connect with predefined nicknames
- Automatically solve expressions
- Simulate different response times
- Test edge cases

## 🔧 Configuration

Key server parameters in `RacingServer.__init__()`:

```python
self.track_length = random.randint(4, 25)  # Race distance
self.time_limit = 10.0                     # Seconds per round
```

Modify these values to adjust game difficulty and pace.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Address already in use" error:**
```bash
# Kill existing server process
pkill -f "python main.py server"
# Or wait ~30 seconds for socket to be released
```

**Client connection issues:**
- Ensure server is running first
- Check firewall settings for localhost connections
- Verify port 12345 is available

**Game doesn't start:**
- Need at least 2 players connected
- Check that all players have completed registration

### Debug Mode
Add debug prints to track issues:
```python
print(f"[DEBUG] Current clients: {len(self.clients)}")
print(f"[DEBUG] Game started: {self.game_started}")
```
